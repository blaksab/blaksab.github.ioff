Hey, I'm Jithendra and welcome to my blog. I'm a **Data Scientist** working at the intersection of analytics, business 
intelligence & machine learning. At [NeenOpal Inc.](https://www.neenopal.com/), I buid data-driven solutions for 
clients across different industries to improve their operational efficiency and quality of decision making.

Currently, I'm building models to enhance 
the customer experience for a leading finance company operating in Sri Lanka. 
Previously, I worked on a forecasting project where I forecasted sales at the SKU level for one 
of the largest tile manufacturing retail organizations in Sri Lanka to improve the manufacturing and inventory process.

Along with the data science and analytics aspects, I have a firm interest in deep learning research and MLOps.

I recently completed my undergraduation in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur.

When I’m not working at the screen, I’ll be mostly banging my head to heavy metal stuff (mostly black/death/doom). 
I also write my opinions over various music albums and bands on my [music blog](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/metblog).

Most of my technical work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jithendrabsy).
Feel free to reach out through [twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy) or mail me at `jithendra1230 [at] gmail [dot] com`.
